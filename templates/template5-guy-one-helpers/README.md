# template 5 guy on3 helpers

I want to have a template that will be a starting point for a number of videos that make use of my guy-one-r0 module along with a number of helper functions that I have made for the module that I have not yet baked into a new revision guyjs.

## video1
* (done) using sequence hooks r2, canvas r1, guyjs r0 and texture r0 
* (done) using a helpers.js to put a lot of code that I am not going to want to repleat in each video file

* () use text-plane r0
* () have a text plane in the scene

* () better methods for setting the texture of a face of the head cube
* () use creepy sheet and have a seq object in which it is used
* () have a seq in which the guy is talking

* () add curve.js r0 as one of the javaScript modules used for this template
* () remove path tools from helpers.js as I am now using curvejs
* () add helpers.js to the guy r0 folder as guy-helpers.js as I am not going to want to have copies of this from video to video
