# collaborative-blog-post-conat

This is a collaborative project between myself and a friend of mine. My friend wanted me to create a work that is a few of my blog post video projects concatanted into a single video project. So for the most part my friend is doing a curation process of sorts with work that I all ready did in the past with my blog post embed projects. Also I am just reworking old code that I all ready have in place. Never the less this is still a collaborative project of sorts that I would like to do more of in the future.
