# timer-hiit

This is a timer video project where I would like to make timer videos that help with the process of [High-intensity interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training).


## What is HIIT?

It is a kind of physical exercise training protocol that involves intervals consisting of short periods of intense anaerobic exercise, with brief recovery periods. These intervals begin after a warm up period, and after ending finish off with a cool down period. There is no set rules in terms of the number of intervals, the amount of time per interval, the ratio of time for high and now intensity exercise, or the amount of time for warm up and cool down periods.

From Wikipedia:

HIIT exercise sessions generally consist of a warm-up period followed by repetitions of high-intensity exercises separated by medium intensity exercises for recovery, then a cool-down period. 

There is no specific formula for HIIT. Depending on one's level of cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking. A common formula involves a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30–40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15–20 seconds of jogging or walking, repeated to failure.
