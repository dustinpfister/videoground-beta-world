## () - video2-camera.js
* (done) start a video2-camera.js file where I will just be working out some logic for camera movement
* (done) work out a simple opening camera movement for COUNT DOWN part
* (done) Color goes from purple to blue in cool down part

* () create a helper method that will create a curve for a camera position for a given interval
* () have a CAMERA-INTERVAL-LOOPS-MIN setting
* () have a CAMERA-INTERVAL-LOOPS-MAX setting

## ( done 02/13/2023 ) - video1-core.js done
* (done) have opacity effects from delay > intervals > cooldown
* (done) create mesh with torus geometry behind the count down wrap
* (done) have a vertex color attribute for the torus geometry
* (done) change the state of the vertex color attribute as a way to display the progress of the current interval
* (done) have color arguments for updateTimeTorus helper
* (done) switch between blue and cyan to help let people know if this is a high or low intensity interval
* (done) thum mode worked out
* (done) count up for cool down part

## ( done 02/12/2023 ) - video1-core.js started
* (done) start a video1-core.js file where I would like to just find out what the core idea of this is
* (done) loose the ground dae scene file for the scene DAE
* (done) do not bother with curve paths for anything at this time
* (done) I will want to have a count down seg object that will be a delay to start
* (done) I will then need a number of interval seg objects that is created by a SETTINGS
