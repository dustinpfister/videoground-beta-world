# samp_tools_midi

I started this file for my audio-generator-midi project folder to hold addtional methods that are like the kind of methods that I would place in my samp tools file, bit these have to do with just midi files rather than general tools. This might then help to break things down more as I would like to at least start to figure out what a final set of files will be for a whole other video ground project folder that is just about sound only.
