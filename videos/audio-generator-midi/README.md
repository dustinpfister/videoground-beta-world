# audo-generator-midi

Another project folder in which I am expanding with what I started with in audio-generator-1, this time the main focus is on midi files. For the most part I think that this will be just importing midi files rather than exporting, I might cross that bridge when and if I come to it, but as of this writing I just want to read midi files on the open web.

## GOALS

The goals of this project are then to continue with what I all ready started with in audio-generator-1, but now the focus is more so on reading data in midi files and using that data to set tone and timeing when creating sample data.

The goals of audo-generator-midi are then:

* ( done video01-01 ) Use a lib such as midi-parser-js to parse midi files to a JSON format
* ( done video01-01 ) use the data JSON data to create a tune using the tools that I have made thus far

* () I will want to play two notes at the same time in a midi file
* () I will want to be able to play more than one track
