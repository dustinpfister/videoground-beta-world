# timer basic

This is my first timer video based off of template6 which is a start point for timer, or count down videos. For the most part this is the same as the template itself, but I made a few changes mainly with the alarm video.


## More that one video to create and them conat

Making one of these is a little different compared to others as I have more that one video javaScript file for these kinds of projects. I create one for the count down, another for the alarm, and then yet another to create a bunch of images one of which I will use for the thumbnail image.

```
# ffmpeg -safe 0 -f concat -i videos.txt -c copy video.mp4
file 'video-cd.mp4'
file 'video-a.mp4'
```
