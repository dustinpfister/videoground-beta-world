# samp-beeper

This is another start with 1-bit music, or beeper music, maybe this time though I will follow threw with this one though as I want to start a few projects where I keep making more videos for the collection indefinitely.

* start out with some draft videos where I just want to work out what the core idea should be to begin with
* once I have a good core system make a number of test videos, at least 3 but as many as 10
* start a whole other videoground content collection based on what I started here.


## videoxx-01-draft-frame-slots

The first draft video that I started for this collection had to do with working out this frame slot system of sorts. This works by breaking each frame down into a collection of slots, and then each slot is broken down into one or more sections for each track. This might prove to work better than just breaking down a frame into an even number of parts, but I can not say that I am happy with it. For this kind of system I might want to break free from doing things on a frame by frame basis, and go back to figuring things on a per second kind of thing.

## videoxx-02-draft-persec

The next draft video idea is to break away from frame by frame in favor of second by second processing of music roll data. Also I want to do away with a fixed number of slots and tracks per frame in favor of a variable number of sections. This should allow for a greater deal of freedom that I will need to get things to sound right.
