# samp-tracker

This is my first take at making a music tracker program working on top of R0 of my samp-create javaScript module.

* I should be able to define a colleciton of patterns
* each pattern should be a collection of events
* each event should be a note index, time delta, and then a collection of waveform paramaters
* have a main file that is a kind of main index of patterns
