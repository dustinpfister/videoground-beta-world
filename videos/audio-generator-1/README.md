# audio-generator-1

This is a collection of video files in which I am working out some basic tools to help me with new features in videoground R10 that allow for me to render data along with the ushual frames. There are maybe a lot of use cases for this, but the main aspet of interest with this is to render audio sample data that I can then playback with the linux aplay command.
