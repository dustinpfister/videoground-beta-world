# breathing-basic

I world like to make a bunch of videos that can help with controlled breathing exercises. This is then the first collection of video files that I have made for this kind of content. In the process of doing so I also ended up starting a few new projects in terms of modules, mainly the breath.js project, but also simple demos for my various blog posts on threejs core features as well..
