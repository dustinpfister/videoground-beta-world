* (done) add more dots, say 28 in total
* (done) have the opacity of each dot start out fully transparent when at the center
* (done) opacity of dots should become fully opaque at about 0.25 of unit length

## ( done 03/02/2023 ) video1-clean.js
* (done) start video1 with the template8 video4-breathr0.js
* (done) use custom methods for curveUpdate, meshUpdate
* (done) use custom hooks
