# audo-generator-waveform

Now that the audo-generator-1 project is more or less done, I should now start to work on more projects in which I continue to build on what I have done thus far. I have a lot of ideas for what this might mean, but as far as this project is concerned the focus will be on waveforms. When I first starting out with writing my own software for creating audio sample data there is starting out with just a simple sine wave, but even with that there are a lot of ways to create even that kind of waveform. When doing so should I do a full waveform for a frequency of 1, or a half wave? Should the amplitude for the wave start a zero and then go to 1 if it is a half wave or should it go from -1 to 1 if the amplitude value is 1? Concerns like this only go up as I start to get into more complex methods of creating waveforms so I started this collection of content in an effort to work some of this stuff out for myself.

## Array waveform videos

I am thinking that this whole collection of videos might involve the use of the 'array' waveform as I am calling it. The display of all the videos will then display the state of the sound as a whole, the state of the current frame, and then also the state of the wavefrom that is being used.

### video01-01-array-lerp

For thi video I am 'lerping' from one waveform to another waveform.
