# samp-create.js

After starting a few projects that have to do with generating audio sample data, I have found that I should start a main js file rather than copying files and hacking over things on a project by project basis. This will then be the start of a project that will be a fixed set of code that I will link to in a set of project folders. If all goes well what I work out here might prove to be the center project for a whole other collection of videos outside of videoground-beta-world all of which have to do with audio syntheses.
