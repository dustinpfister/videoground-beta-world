# hum DAE File

The idea here was to just start out with a 2d outline of a humming brid in blender. As of this writing I have found out how to do just that in blender 2.79. I just need to use the background images interface in the same user plane that I use to set the absolute posiiton of the cursor, and to change vertex normal helper settings. Once I have the image I want to use I can set the view to to orthographic by hiting numbad 5 or the option in the view menu. I can then use the view method to set the video to look along a given axis and the resource image should then be there. I can then use a plane geometry, subdivide, or do whatever to create the 2d outline.

After making the 2d outline there is then the question of where to go from there.
