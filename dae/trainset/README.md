# trainset dae files

This is a collection of DAE files that can be used to set up a basic train set scene. I started this for my timer-train video project, but might also use this in other video project collections as well.

## land-1 DAE file

With land-1 DAE I just want to start out with some land on which the train, and additional landscape objects will be placed. I just need to create some quick geometry for the land, and when it comes to textures I will be using that as a way to paint on the railway. There should be at least one mountain range, and I would like to have a tunnel for that mountain of course to which the train will move threw.

## train-1 DAE file

This will be the geometry and textures for the train itself.

## landscape-1 DAE file

This will not be the land itself of course as that is done with the land-1 DAE file, however this is where I will park all other objects that will be placed in the over all scene.
