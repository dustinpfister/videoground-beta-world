# trainset dae files

This is a collection of DAE files that can be used to set up a basic train set scene. I started this for my timer-train video project, but might also use this in other video project collections as well.

## land-1.dae

With land-1 dae I just want to start out with a starting state for some land on which the train will be. I all ready have a crude place holder for the train mesh. So I just need to create some quick geometry for the land, and set up the curve that I want for the train movement. There should be at least one mountain range, and I would like to have a tunnel for that mountain of course.
