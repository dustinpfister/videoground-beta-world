# guy2 dae folder

The aim here is to make a new 'guy model' if it can be called that based off of what i worked out for the first guy folder that is more or less the same, only with a few more mesh objects. Each arm and leg should be a group of three mesh objects, and aside from that the guy looks about the same as the first one.
