# count_down_basic

This is a copy of the DAE files for use with my count-down.js file from test_threejs

## cd3-nums.blend, cd3-ground.blend, DAE Textures

I want to have two DAE files now one for numbers, and the other for the rest of the scene. The general idea with this is that I might want to have more than one dae file for the rest of the objects while still using the same numbers. This might prove to be a better option compared to having everything in a single DAE file. The other thing that I would like to work out is having textures for the objects as well.

* (done) have a cd3-nums.blend that will just be the numbers
* (done) have a cd3-ground.blend that will be the rest of the scene
* (done) work out a texture for cd3-ground.blend
* (done) make textures for cd3-nums.blend
