# VideoGround Beta world video files

I have made an electron.js powered program that I aim to use to make little video projects That for now I am just simply calling video ground. As of this writing I am working on revision 3 of the prototype for videoground that can be found in the [proto folder of my electronjs examples](https://github.com/dustinpfister/examples-electronjs/tree/master/proto) repo as I have not wrote a post on the project example yet. 

I am now thinking that I should start making at least some actual content with what I have togetaher rather than putting this off until a later revision is done with more features and a better refined system for how I go about defining the logic for a video. If I do put off making videos then I might just keep on working on the applaction rather than making videos with it. If that happens then I might loose interst in working on it so I started this reposatory to store files and data that are for certian ideas for videos rather than the applaction.

This is then the collection of files to use with videoground to create frames that can then be used with a program like ffmpeg to create a final video file. Addtional tools like espeak, aduacity, musesocre and so forth can then be used to create auto tracks for a finished product as well.

## The general idea of 'Beta World'

The term Beta is a reference to Beta Software, so in other words the Beta World is a world the is feature compleate, but will contain a lot of problems, or for on reason or another not feel like a finihsed product. In the beta world there are just two characters, 'guy1', and 'guy2' and a world of objects in which they can interact with for a series of videos. All of the various assets should be in place at least when I start the very first video, although much of the fine deatils of everything might only be refined as needed from one video project to the next.
