# VideoGround Beta world video files

I have made an electron.js powered program that I aim to use to make little video projects that for now I am just simply calling [videoground](https://github.com/dustinpfister/videoground). So then I should start making some content with this program then, rather than putting this off until a later revision is done that might not even come.

This is then a collection of files to use with videoground to create frames that can then be used with a program like ffmpeg to create a final video file. Additional tools like [espeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESpeak), [audacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_%28audio_editor%29), [musescore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MuseScore) and so forth can then be used to create audio tracks for a finished product as well. Also as of late revisions of videoground \( R10+ \) I can now both read and write additional data on a frame by frame basis which includes audio sample data.

## The current idea of 'Beta World' is *experimentation*

The current idea for this beta world collection of content is to just use this is a place to park experimental content to gain a better sense of what I like to make with videoground. I have a lot of general ideas for content and as such I just need a place to park what I have together with these ideas. If something works in terms of intrinsic value, or external interest maybe I will start a stand alone collection for that, otherwise it will remain here.

## The Original general idea of 'Beta World'

The term Beta is in reference to Beta Software, so in other words the Beta World is a world that is feature complete, but will contain a lot of problems, or for on reason or another does not feel like a finished product just yet. 

The original idea for beta world was to make a series of skit like videos where there are just two characters, 'guy1', and 'guy2' and a world of objects in which they can interact with. All of the various assets should be in place when I start the very first video, and each video would just be another project where I am just playing around with assets that are all ready in place. 

However I have found that idea was a little overambitious, and I am now thinking that I will be treating beta word as just a general collection of video content in which I am experimenting with a bunch of different ideas in which the original idea is just one of.
