# VideoGround Beta world video files

I have made an electron.js powered program that I aim to use to make little video projects that for now I am just simply calling [videoground](https://github.com/dustinpfister/videoground). I am now thinking that I should start making at least some actual content with what I have together rather than putting this off until a later revision is done. This is then the collection of files to use with videoground to create frames that can then be used with a program like ffmpeg to create a final video file. Additional tools like espeak, aduacity, musesocre and so forth can then be used to create audio tracks for a finished product as well.

## The current idea of 'Beta World'

The current idea for this beta world collection of content is to just use this is a general collection of experimental content to gain a better sense of what I like to make with videoground. I have a lot of general ideas for content and as such I just need a place to park what I have together with these ideas.

## The Original general idea of 'Beta World'

The term Beta is a reference to Beta Software, so in other words the Beta World is a world that is feature complete, but will contain a lot of problems, or for on reason or another does not feel like a finished product. The original idea for beta works was to make a series of skit like videos where there are just two characters, 'guy1', and 'guy2' and a world of objects in which they can interact with. All of the various assets should be in place at least when I start the very first video, although much of the fine details of everything might only be refined as needed from one video project to the next. However I have found that idea was a little overambitious, and I am now thinking that I will be treating beta word as just a general collection of video content in which I am experimenting with a bunch of different ideas in which the original idea is just one of.
